"""Where one contract's Algo runs: its candles, its warm-up, its day.

`algo.AlgoSignal` decides; `bands.SpreadCandles` measures; `AlgoRun` feeds
them on every pass and keeps what the window shows beside the signal —
the last signal held back and why, the last order and what became of it,
the day's count. It never reaches an order: the engine acts on the
intents it returns.

- **History is the recording.** A FIX market-data session has no bars to
  backfill from, so the candles are built from the mids this system
  recorded, and the window says "collecting 7/20" until there are N.
- **The warm-up is live time watched since the Algo was armed.** A band
  built from the recording is not a feed that has been watched. A quick
  restart carries it (`WARMUP_CARRY_SEC`); standing the Algo down resets it.
- **The day's limits** — trades, a losing run, the money lost — stop
  ENTRIES for the rest of the day and say which. Exits carry on.
