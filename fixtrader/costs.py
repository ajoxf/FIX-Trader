"""What a round trip costs, where break-even is, and where the target is.

The three are one chain and they are here together because separating them is
how they drift apart:

    round trip  = (commission + exchange + clearing) x 2 sides x qty
                + slippage_budget_ticks x 2 sides x tick_value x qty

    break-even  = fill +/- round_trip / (money_per_point x qty)
    target      = break-even +/- (pct/100 x basis) / (money_per_point x qty)

Two rules the whole module is built to keep:

- **Unmeasured is not zero.** No tick value, or no margin from the venue,
  means no break-even and no target: return None and let the screen render an
  em dash. A target of 0.00 reads as "get out at break-even", which is a
  different instruction, and a break-even of "the price you paid" reads as
  correct while being a lie.
- **The slippage figure here is a BUDGET, not a measurement.** The Analysis
  window reports the measured figure beside it so this gets corrected from
  data. Default it to 0 rather than inventing a cost and charging it against
  every trade the operator never agreed to.
