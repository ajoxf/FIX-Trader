"""Sending, re-pricing, escalating and closing. One path for entries and exits.

The operator chose MARKET or LIMIT **independently for entries and exits**, so
every combination has to work — limit-in / limit-out included. That is why
there is one `place` here taking an `Intent` rather than a `send_entry` and a
`send_exit` that would drift apart.

The rules that make the limit path safe, and the reasons they exist:

- **Amend by cancel-replace, never cancel-then-new.** The second gives up the
  queue AND opens a window in which the order does not exist at all — a window
  a fast market walks straight through.
- **Re-price only outside the dead band.** Every amend loses queue position,
  so re-pricing on every pass guarantees you are never at the front of a
  queue, which defeats quoting entirely.
- **A closing order is capped at the open position and carries reduce-only.**
  An exit that overfills opens the opposite side of a spread the desk thought
  it had left.
- **Nothing withholds the escalation on a CLOSE.** If an exit limit times out
  and the contract escalates, it escalates — through a stale quote, through a
  settling jump, through any filter.
