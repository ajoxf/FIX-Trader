"""The loop. One pass per contract, one snapshot out.

Everything the screen shows comes from `snapshot()`, and everything the screen
can ask for arrives as a command. The engine never talks to the browser and
the browser never talks to a venue.

Order of a pass, and it matters:

1. read the book, and let the guards observe it;
2. drain what the venue said since last time, and fold it into our own book
   FIRST — acting on a stale idea of the position is how a close becomes a
   reversal;
3. add the mid to the statistics, and record any standard-deviation touch;
4. manage working limits (re-price, escalate);
5. ask for an exit, then an entry. **Exits are considered first, always** —
   a pass that runs out of budget must have got the position out, not in.
