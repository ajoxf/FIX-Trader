"""Replay recorded prices through the Algo: what it WOULD have done.

The same decision code the live Algo runs — `algo.AlgoSignal` for the
entry and the exits, `algo.judge_filters` for the filters, `algo.levels`
for the stop and the target, the same band — fed one candle at a time.
The candles are built from this system's own recording of the contract's
mid: a FIX market-data session has no history to ask for. Nothing here
can reach an order.

What it cannot see, and says so in its result:

- **Inside a candle.** Each candle is one look at the price, at its close:
  a stop touched and recovered inside the candle is not seen, and an exit
  is taken at the close it was seen at.
- **The book.** The bid-ask is one width, held constant.
- **Confirmation in quotes.** Live, an entry needs N fresh quotes in a
  row; here one candle close is one confirmation.
- **The warm-up and the live feed checks**, which are about the live tape.
