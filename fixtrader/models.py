"""Dataclasses and enums. No logic, no I/O, nothing that can fail.

Two conventions in here are load-bearing everywhere else:

- **None means "unknown", and it is not "flat" or "zero".** `BookTop.bid` of
  None is "we could not read the bid"; a `positions()` of None is "we could not
  read the account", which is a completely different statement from "there are
  no positions". Code that treats the first as the second will report a clean
  account while the money sits at the venue.
- **Every figure that a decision was made on is stored on the record**, not
  recomputed later. The z on a trade is the z the entry actually fired at; a
  later change to the lookback must not be able to rewrite history.
