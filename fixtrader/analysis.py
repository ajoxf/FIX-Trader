"""The feedback loop: what each contract actually did, and what to change.

Scoped to ONE contract at a time, deliberately. A win rate blended across
eight contracts cannot answer the only question this window exists for —
which contract to turn off — and the All-contracts view is a comparison, not
an average.

Three rules run through every figure in here:

- **Closed trades only.** An open position is named and excluded. A system
  that counts an open winner is a system that flatters itself.
- **Unmeasured is not zero.** A trade whose net could not be computed, a fill
  whose slippage could not be priced, a touch still running — each is counted
  separately and left out of the average, never folded in as a zero. Averaging
  in zeros understates costs and overstates reversion, which are the two
  numbers a desk would act on.
- **Under ten closed trades gets no verdict.** Six losing trades is not
  evidence, and a page that says so is worth more than one that ranks noise.
