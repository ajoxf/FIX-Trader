"""UAT order tests: every order path the desk will use in a live market,
placed for real on TT UAT and checked against what TT answers.

Run it from the screen — the ORDER TESTS page (/order-tests) — or against
the running program from a terminal:

    python -m fixtrader.uat --contract esz6            (or run_uat_tests.bat)

It drives the program the way the screen does — the same commands the ladder
and the Algo window send — so what is tested is the path a trader uses, not a
side door. Each scenario places its orders, waits for TT's answer, checks the
working order, the fill, the position and the close on this program's book,
and reads back the FIX tags it actually sent (the FIX log). It cleans up after
itself: anything of its own still working is cancelled and anything it opened
is closed, by ticket.

Manual (the ladder / manual ticket, FTM- orders):
  M1  LIMIT away from the market rests, shows as working, cancels
  M2  a resting LIMIT is replaced to a new price, then cancelled
  M3  MARKET opens; the position shows; a MARKET close by ticket (77=C) flattens
  M4  a marketable LIMIT fills; Close @ LMT rests (77=C); cancelled; market close
  M5  a LIMIT at the touch fills when the price is hit (waits; may not trade)
  M6  an order TT refuses is shown in TT's own words (tag 58)
  M7  MARKET SELL opens a short; a MARKET close by ticket (77=C) flattens
  M8  SELL LIMIT above the market rests, shows as working, cancels
Algo (its own path, FT- orders, 1028=N):
  A1  MARKET opens; the Algo's position shows with TT's tickets; CLOSE NOW
      closes it by ticket (77=C)
  A2  LIMIT away from the market rests, shows as working, cancels
  A3  a marketable LIMIT fills; Close @ LMT rests pinned (77=C); CLOSE ALL
      escalates it — cancel, then market — never two closes at once
  A4  a LIMIT at the touch fills when the price is hit (waits; may not trade)
  A5  MARKET SELL opens a short; CLOSE NOW closes it by ticket
  A6  SELL LIMIT above the market rests, shows as working, cancels

Refused anywhere but a UAT venue. Quantity 1 unless told otherwise.
